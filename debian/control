Description: data driven testing framework for Perl
 Testing is usually the ugly part of Perl module authoring. Perl gives you a
 standard way to run tests with Test::Harness, and basic testing primitives
 with Test::More. After that you are pretty much on your own to develop a
 testing framework and philosophy. Test::More encourages you to make your own
 framework by subclassing Test::Builder, but that is not trivial.
 .
 Test::Base gives you a way to write your own test framework base class that is
 trivial. In fact it is as simple as two lines:
   package MyTestFramework;
   use Test::Base -Base;
 .
 A module called MyTestFramework.pm containing those two lines, will give all
 the power of Test::More and all the power of Test::Base to every test file
 that uses it. As you build up the capabilities of MyTestFramework, your tests
 will have all of that power as well.
 .
 MyTestFramework becomes a place for you to put all of your reusable testing
 bits. As you write tests, you will see patterns and duplication, and you can
 "upstream" them into MyTestFramework. Of course, you don't have to subclass
 Test::Base at all. You can use it directly in many applications, including
 everywhere you would use Test::More.
 .
 Test::Base concentrates on offering reusable data driven patterns, so that you
 can write tests with a minimum of code. At the heart of all testing you have
 inputs, processes and expected outputs. Test::Base provides some clean ways
 for you to express your input and expected output data, so you can spend your
 time focusing on that rather than your code scaffolding.
